# Slack MCP Client
A slack bot with an MCP client for slack in Typescript.

Current support for:
- HTTP Streamable, Stdio MCP servers as defined in version 2025-03-26
- The Oauth based authorization flow defined in version 2025-03-26
- SSE MCP servers as defined in the previous version of the protocol.

Check out the video for a brief overview of what it can do! The video is using [this linkedin-mcp-server](https://github.com/fredericbarthelet/linkedin-mcp-server) which supports the latest authentication specification of the protocol.
